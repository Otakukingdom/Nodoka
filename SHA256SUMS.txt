# SHA256 Checksums for Nodoka v0.2.0 Installers
#
# This file is generated by CI in the generate-checksums job and uploaded with
# release artifacts. The repo copy is a template because release installers are
# not stored in git.
#
# To generate locally after building all installers:
#   shasum -a 256 packaging/macos/Nodoka-0.2.0.dmg > SHA256SUMS.txt
#   sha256sum packaging/linux/nodoka_0.2.0_amd64.deb >> SHA256SUMS.txt
#   (Windows) certutil -hashfile packaging\\windows\\nodoka-0.2.0-x64.msi SHA256 >> SHA256SUMS.txt
#
# The release SHA256SUMS.txt must contain exactly three lines, one per installer:
# <sha256>  Nodoka-0.2.0.dmg
# <sha256>  nodoka_0.2.0_amd64.deb
# <sha256>  nodoka-0.2.0-x64.msi
